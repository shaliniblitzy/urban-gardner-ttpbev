## Introduction

Welcome to the Garden Planner project! This document provides comprehensive guidelines for contributing to our mobile application designed for optimized home gardening management.

### Project Overview
Garden Planner is a cross-platform mobile application built with React Native, utilizing TypeScript for core logic. The application focuses on:
- Space optimization algorithms (F-001)
- Maintenance scheduling system (F-002)
- Local data persistence
- Push notification management

### Types of Contributions
- Feature Development
- Bug Fixes
- Performance Optimizations
- Documentation Updates
- Test Coverage Improvements

### Getting Started
1. Fork the repository
2. Set up your development environment
3. Create a feature branch
4. Make your changes
5. Submit a pull request

## Development Workflow

### Environment Setup

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18.x
- React Native CLI 0.72.x
- Xcode 15.0+ (for iOS)
- Android Studio 2023.1+ (for Android)
- TypeScript 5.0+

#### Platform-Specific Setup

iOS Development:
```bash
cd ios
pod install
```

Android Development:
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
```

### Branch Management

#### Branch Naming Convention
- Feature: `feature/F-001-space-optimizer`
- Bug Fix: `fix/F-002-notification-delay`
- Refactor: `refactor/core-algorithm`
- Documentation: `docs/contribution-guide`

### Local Development

1. Create your branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. Enable development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Run platform-specific tests:
```bash
# iOS
npm run test:ios

# Android
npm run test:android
```

## Code Standards

### TypeScript/React Native
