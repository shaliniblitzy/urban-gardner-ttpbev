- Store configuration in `src/store`
- Actions and reducers in feature-specific folders
- Middleware for side effects
- Persistence using redux-persist

### Testing

Comprehensive testing setup includes:
- Jest for unit testing
- React Native Testing Library for component testing
- E2E testing with Detox
- MSW for API mocking

### Code Style

The project enforces consistent code style through:
- ESLint configuration
- Prettier formatting
- TypeScript strict mode
- Husky pre-commit hooks
